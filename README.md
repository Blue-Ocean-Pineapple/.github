# Chores

## Getting Started
MAKE SURE TO cd into chores folder(with no capitalized c)

1. Download dependencies with:

   > `npm install`

2. Run with:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Components


### Register + Sign in + Profile + Logout
User can sign in and up a new account via email/Password or Google or Facebook.User can add additional information on profile page. User will only be directed to their role path depending on their particular role. 
User can log out their account via logout. 

### Customer
We need a secure app, where customers can login and submit a ticket for the type of work they need done.
Once their ticket is submitted they should get a confirmation that it was submitted, and see a screen with all of their open tickets along with their status (e.g. awaiting approval, approved, in-progress).
They should also have a button that shows all of their completed tickets.
Anyone can create a customer account.

### Staff
Staff has a more administrative role, and will have the most tools.
Staff will approve submitted tickets from customers, and assign student(s) and at least 1 staff member to each ticket to move it into “in-progress” status. They will also be in charge of moving the status to complete.
Staff will also be able to invite or approve student profiles, and also deactivate any existing student profile.
Staff profiles should require an invite or approval from other staff members, or from an admin.


### Admin
An admin role would consist of core staff members (managers).
The admin should be able to delete any of the other account types, modify open tickets, and invite/approve staff/student accounts.


### Student
The students should be able to login and see approved tickets and be able to vote (a heart, star, or thumbs up icon) on the tickets they would like to volunteer for.
They should also be able to see tickets that a staff member has assigned them to.
Students should also be able to see the history of tickets they completed.
Student profiles require approval from a staff member before they can be used.
